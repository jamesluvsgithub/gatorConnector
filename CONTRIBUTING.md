# How to contribute

There are two branches that will be used for this app: ```main``` and  ```dev```.
```main``` is a stable, user-ready version of the app. Everything we do here is to make sure that ```main``` does not break.
```dev``` is the branch that will be used for development of new features.

The workflow will look like:

```feature/* -> dev -> main```

## Contributing

# gatorConnector

gatorConnect is an app that will help people at UF and Santa Fe CC connect with one another. Students and faculty can use this app to search for  friendships, mentorships, or both! People can also choose to be either mentors or mentees.

This app will function much like other social networking apps. Users will create a profile and add information about themselves. Based on the information they submit, the app will display other users and they can decide whether they would like to connect or not. Profile info includes, name, age, major, and hobbies!

This is group 5 of CEN3031 spring 2026.
